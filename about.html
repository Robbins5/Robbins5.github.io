        <h2>About This Newsletter</h2>
        <p>
            Applied AI Observer explores how research and coding assistants are being used in real enterprise environments.
            The focus is on practical, applied tools rather than theory, with an emphasis on how professionals are actually
            experimenting with and adopting AI in their day-to-day work.
        </p>

        <p>
            This newsletter is created as part of CAH 205: Applied AI and tracks current developments, tool releases,
            comparisons, and emerging trends in applied artificial intelligence.
