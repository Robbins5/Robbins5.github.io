          <p class="exec-subtitle" style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
            As enterprises scale and systems interconnect, internal audit coverage increasingly shifts from periodic, sample-based testing
            toward population signals, monitoring routines, and reconstructable evidence. Executive oversight of the audit function is most effective
            when expectations are stated in terms of outputs, timelines, and closure discipline rather than tool adoption.
