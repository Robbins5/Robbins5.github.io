            <h2>Rethinking Internal Audit in the Age of AI</h2>
            <p class="date">February 8, 2026</p>

            <p>
                Artificial intelligence is now embedded across many industrial and distribution environments,
                supporting forecasting, pricing, inventory management, logistics, and customer-facing processes.
                As these technologies scale, internal audit must evolve how it evaluates fraud risk, segregation
                of duties, and operational efficiency in systems that no longer behave in simple or linear ways.
            </p>

            <p>
                Professional standards and regulatory guidance consistently emphasize that accountability does
                not shift when automated tools are introduced. Organizations remain responsible for outcomes,
                including those influenced by AI-enabled decision-making. This expectation reshapes how internal
                audit approaches control design, testing, and assurance.
            </p>

            <h3>Regulatory and Professional Expectations for AI and Automation</h3>

            <p>
                Guidance from the
                :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
                reinforces internal audit’s responsibility to evaluate emerging risks, including those related
                to automation, data integrity, and governance. This includes assessing whether controls keep
                pace with how technology is actually used in operations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Frameworks such as the
                :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
                AI Risk Management Framework further highlight expectations around transparency, monitoring,
                and lifecycle management. While not prescriptive regulation, these principles increasingly
                shape regulator and stakeholder expectations across industries.
            </p>

            <h3>Revisiting the Control Matrix for AI-Driven Risk</h3>

            <p>
                Traditional control matrices were designed around static processes and predictable system
                behavior. AI introduces adaptive logic that can change outcomes over time, often without
                obvious configuration changes. As a result, control design must move beyond one-time checks
                toward controls that emphasize ongoing oversight and accountability.
            </p>

            <p>
                In distribution environments, this has direct implications for fraud and segregation of duties.
                AI-enabled pricing tools, inventory optimization models, or logistics automation can amplify
                the impact of inappropriate access or override capabilities. Controls must therefore address
                not only system access, but also who can influence data inputs, model parameters, and downstream
                decisions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Control matrices should explicitly consider risks such as conflicting access across order
                entry, pricing, inventory movement, and credit functions. When AI is involved, these conflicts
                may not be obvious at the transaction level but can emerge through repeated patterns over time.
            </p>

            <h3>Fraud, Behavioral Patterns, and Segregation of Duties Testing</h3>

            <p>
                Fraud risks associated with AI-enabled processes often manifest as patterns rather than isolated
                events. This includes pricing adjustments that consistently benefit specific customers, inventory
                movements that align with delivery anomalies, or overrides that cluster around certain users or
                time periods.
            </p>

            <p>
                Traditional sample-based testing struggles to detect these risks, particularly in high-volume
                environments. Internal audit must increasingly rely on population-level testing, behavioral
                analysis, and pattern recognition to identify anomalies that warrant investigation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Segregation of duties testing also requires a broader lens. Many organizations operate across
                multiple platforms such as ERP systems, logistics tools, and customer portals. When these systems
                operate in silos, SOD conflicts may only become visible when access and activity are analyzed
                end-to-end across the full process.
            </p>

            <h3>Breaking Down Silos Through Audit Analytics</h3>

            <p>
                One of the most significant challenges in modern audit environments is fragmented data.
                Operational platforms, financial systems, and third-party tools often operate independently,
                limiting the organization’s ability to see risk patterns across the full transaction lifecycle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Internal audit analytics platforms play a critical role in bridging these gaps. By integrating
                data across systems, audit teams can evaluate pricing, inventory, billing, and logistics activity
                as a connected process rather than isolated events. This enables more effective fraud detection,
                SOD analysis, and identification of inefficiencies that would otherwise remain hidden.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pattern recognition techniques allow auditors to identify unusual behaviors, repeated overrides,
                or process deviations that may indicate control weaknesses, fraud risk, or operational breakdowns.
                These insights support more targeted testing and more meaningful conversations with management.
            </p>

            <h3>Identifying Inefficiency and Control Breakdown at Scale</h3>

            <p>
                Beyond fraud and compliance, AI-enabled audit techniques help identify inefficiencies that can
                signal deeper control issues. Examples include repeated manual interventions, frequent pricing
                exceptions, delayed billing, or inventory discrepancies that align with specific operational
                patterns.
            </p>

            <p>
                In distribution environments where margins can be thin and transaction volumes high, small
                inefficiencies can scale quickly. Internal audit is uniquely positioned to surface these trends
                by combining process knowledge with analytics-driven testing.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Investment in Audit Capability Is No Longer Optional</h3>

            <p>
                As business units adopt AI and automation rapidly, governance and assurance functions often lag
                behind. Without adequate tools, data access, and skilled resources, internal audit risks becoming
                reactive rather than proactive.
            </p>

            <p>
                Investment in audit analytics, automation, and training is not about expanding scope unnecessarily.
                It is about enabling internal audit to provide relevant, credible assurance over systems that
                increasingly drive financial and operational outcomes.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the age of AI, internal audit’s effectiveness depends on its ability to see across silos,
                detect patterns at scale, and evaluate risk as it actually exists. Organizations that prioritize
                these capabilities position internal audit as a strategic partner rather than a backward-looking
                control function.
