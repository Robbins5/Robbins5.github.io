            <h2>Rethinking Internal Audit in the Age of AI</h2>
            <p class="date">February 8, 2026</p>

            <p>
                As artificial intelligence becomes embedded across business processes, internal audit teams
                are facing a familiar challenge in an unfamiliar context: how to provide assurance over systems
                that are adaptive, probabilistic, and increasingly autonomous. Traditional audit approaches,
                while still foundational, are no longer sufficient on their own.
            </p>

            <p>
                The introduction of AI does not eliminate risk. It reshapes it. Models evolve, data pipelines
                expand, and decision-making moves faster than legacy control structures were designed to handle.
                In response, internal audit must rethink how controls are defined, how testing is performed,
                and how assurance is delivered at scale.
            </p>

            <h3>Updating the Control Matrix for AI-Enabled Processes</h3>

            <p>
                Many existing control matrices assume static systems with predictable inputs and outputs.
                AI-driven processes challenge this assumption. Controls must now account for data quality,
                model governance, change management, and ongoing monitoring rather than one-time configuration
                checks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead of focusing solely on transactional controls, audit teams should introduce controls
                that address the AI lifecycle. This includes controls over training data sources, access to
                model configuration, approval of model updates, and validation of outputs used in decision-making.
                Ownership and accountability become especially important when AI tools are embedded across
                multiple functions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Importantly, control design should distinguish between AI used for decision support and AI used
                for automated decision-making. The risk profile and control expectations differ significantly,
                and treating them the same can result in gaps that go undetected.
            </p>

            <h3>Rethinking Testing Procedures and Audit Methodology</h3>

            <p>
                Testing AI-related controls requires a shift away from purely sample-based approaches.
                While sampling remains relevant, it is often insufficient when risks manifest through patterns,
                drift, or cumulative behavior over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Audit procedures should increasingly emphasize population-level analysis, trend detection,
                and exception monitoring. This allows auditors to evaluate how AI systems behave in practice,
                not just whether controls exist on paper. Continuous or near-continuous testing becomes far
                more valuable than point-in-time reviews.
            </p>

            <p>
                Documentation standards must also evolve. Testing procedures should clearly describe how AI
                outputs were evaluated, what assumptions were made, and how auditors assessed reliability.
                This level of transparency is essential not only for audit quality but also for regulator
                and stakeholder confidence.
            </p>

            <h3>Tools That Enable Scale and Deeper Assurance</h3>

            <p>
                To keep pace with AI-driven environments, internal audit teams need tools that extend beyond
                spreadsheets and manual walkthroughs. Data analytics platforms, automated testing frameworks,
                and AI-assisted audit tools enable auditors to analyze larger data sets with greater precision
                and consistency.
            </p>

            <p>
                These tools allow audit functions to shift effort away from repetitive testing and toward
                higher-value analysis and judgment. For example, analytics can be used to identify anomalies
                across entire populations, while AI-assisted tools can help auditors summarize results,
                identify emerging risks, and focus attention where it matters most.
            </p>

            <p>
                Importantly, tool adoption should be aligned with audit objectives rather than driven by novelty.
                The goal is not to automate for the sake of automation, but to enhance coverage, improve insight,
                and support more timely assurance.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Investment and Resourcing Matter Now</h3>

            <p>
                One of the greatest risks organizations face is underestimating the pace at which AI adoption
                is accelerating. Business units are often quick to implement new tools, while governance and
                assurance functions struggle to keep up.
            </p>

            <p>
                Without appropriate funding and skilled resources, internal audit risks becoming reactive rather
                than proactive. This gap can undermine the organization’s overall risk posture and reduce
                leadership’s confidence in the assurance being provided.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prioritizing investment in people, training, and technology is not about expanding audit for
                its own sake. It is about ensuring that internal audit remains relevant, credible, and capable
                of fulfilling its role as AI becomes a permanent part of the operating environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the age of AI, internal audit’s value lies not only in what it reviews, but in how effectively
                it adapts. Teams that evolve their control frameworks, testing approaches, and toolsets will be
                best positioned to provide meaningful assurance in a rapidly changing landscape.
