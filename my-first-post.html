            <h2>AI Coding Assistants Are Becoming Control-Critical Tools in Operational Industries</h2>
            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

            <p>
                AI coding assistants such as Claude and Microsoft Copilot are increasingly used to support analytics,
                automation, and system logic across enterprise environments. According to product documentation from
                Anthropic, Claude is designed to explain, refactor, and generate code for analytical and operational
                use cases. Microsoft similarly positions Copilot as an assistant embedded within enterprise platforms
                used for reporting, data analysis, and process automation.
            </p>

            <p>
                In operational industries like electrical distribution, even small changes to analytical logic can
                affect inventory planning, pricing decisions, logistics optimization, and financial reporting.
                Industry guidance from the National Association of Electrical Distributors highlights the growing
                reliance on advanced analytics and automation to manage complex supply chains and margin pressure.
                As AI contributes to this logic, the potential impact on internal controls increases.

            AI-assisted logic can influence operational and financial outcomes, making governance and control design critical
            </p>
            <p>
                This development directly relates to Institute of Internal Auditors Standard 2130, which requires
                organizations to maintain effective internal controls, and to the COSO Internal Control – Integrated
                Framework, which emphasizes accountability and documentation for control activities. AI-assisted
                coding challenges both frameworks if governance expectations are not updated.
            </p>

            <p>
                My takeaway is that organizations should formally recognize AI coding assistants as control-impacting
                tools. Establishing AI advisory boards or cross-functional governance groups that include IT,
                operations, legal, risk, and audit can help define expectations for testing, documentation, and
                accountability.
            </p>

            <p>
                Internal audit teams must also upskill to understand how AI-generated logic is created and where
                control risks can emerge, particularly in systems that support core operational processes. As these
                tools become embedded in day-to-day work, audit’s role expands from reviewing outputs to evaluating
                how AI-assisted logic is designed, tested, and governed.
