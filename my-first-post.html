        <h2>AI Coding Assistants Are Becoming Control-Critical Tools in Operational Industries</h2>
        <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

        <p>
            This series is written for internal audit teams and business leaders who want to adopt AI confidently,
            without creating blind spots in controls, compliance, customer experience, or decision-making. The intent is
            practical. Position internal audit as a partner that helps the organization scale AI responsibly and measurably.
        </p>

        <p>
            AI coding assistants and agent-enabled workflows are moving from “developer convenience” to “business-critical capability.”
            Teams use tools like Microsoft Copilot and Claude to accelerate analytics, generate SQL and scripts, draft automation logic,
            and support workflows that touch purchasing, pricing, inventory, logistics, credit, and customer interactions.
            In electrical and communications distribution, small logic changes can scale quickly across thousands of SKUs, customers,
            and transactions, which is why this belongs in the control conversation early and consistently.
        </p>

        <p class="image-caption">
            AI-enabled logic can influence operational outcomes and financial reporting processes, which makes governance and control design an assurance issue.
        </p>

        <h3>What is changing</h3>
        <p>
            Traditional automation tends to be deterministic. A script runs the same way until someone changes it.
            Many AI-enabled capabilities behave differently. Machine learning can evolve based on data inputs, usage patterns,
            configuration changes, and vendor updates. Even when an organization does not “launch an AI project,” AI may still be
            influencing decisions through embedded features in tools the business already uses.
        </p>

        <p>
            This shift matters in distribution environments, where decision support is everywhere. Forecasting, margin guidance,
            exception routing, ticket triage, customer messaging, and operational analytics increasingly rely on systems that can learn
            or generate outputs. AI value and AI risk can scale together, and internal audit is well positioned to help leadership keep
            that scale controlled, documented, and explainable.
        </p>

        <h3>Why leadership should care</h3>
        <p>
            In operational distribution, process decisions become financial outcomes. Pricing logic affects margin, inventory optimization
            affects working capital, delivery commitments affect customer retention, and quote turnaround influences win rates.
            AI-supported decisions can shift over time as inputs change. Without clear governance and monitoring, performance can drift and
            downstream financial controls can be affected without a clear signal that anything “changed.”
        </p>

        <p>
            There is also a customer-facing dimension. As organizations introduce AI assistance into customer service, quoting,
            and communications, AI output may reach customers directly. That influences customer experience, contract expectations,
            and brand trust. Good governance helps the organization innovate while protecting customer relationships.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            A constructive governance mindset: AI is a capability that needs ongoing oversight, not a one-time implementation.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>What internal audit needs to understand</h3>
        <p>
            Internal audit does not need to become a team of data scientists. Audit does need enough fluency to understand where AI shows up,
            how it can influence decisions, and what “good evidence” looks like in AI-enabled processes.
            The Institute of Internal Auditors emphasizes that internal audit evaluates governance, risk management, and controls across
            significant activities. As AI becomes part of those activities, audit scope expands accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most important practical shift is this: AI risk is not limited to internally developed models or formally announced pilots.
            AI is increasingly embedded in third-party platforms, released through product upgrades, and enabled through configuration.
            If the business uses enterprise software, the business may be using AI, sometimes without calling it that.
        </p>

        <p>
            For internal audit, the question becomes: where can AI-enabled logic influence operational decisions, customer interactions,
            or financial outcomes, and do we have controls and evidence that keep those outcomes reliable?
        </p>

        <h3>What internal audit should track beyond “AI projects”</h3>
        <p>
            A practical approach is to start with high-impact workflows and map where AI can influence them. Internal audit can focus on:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data inputs and quality:</strong> what data is used, what is excluded, and how quality and lineage are validated</li>
            <li><strong>Decision points:</strong> where recommendations or classifications influence pricing, inventory, credit, or customer commitments</li>
            <li><strong>Automation points:</strong> where AI output triggers actions, not just analysis</li>
            <li><strong>Change drivers:</strong> who can change prompts, configurations, thresholds, connectors, or permissions</li>
            <li><strong>Vendor updates:</strong> what changes through release notes, feature toggles, or model upgrades in core platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Where the risks show up first</h3>
        <p>
            The risks are familiar, but they appear in new forms. Internal audit already understands how weak controls lead to losses, errors,
            and operational breakdowns. AI changes speed, scale, and visibility.
        </p>

        <h4>Fraud and misuse risk increases with capability</h4>
        <p>
            AI can reduce the effort required to generate convincing messages, manipulate information, or accelerate social engineering.
            It can also make it easier to create plausible exception narratives and documentation. Fraud risk is not new, but AI can amplify
            both opportunity and concealment. This is why audit collaboration with cybersecurity, legal, HR, and operations becomes more important.
        </p>

        <h4>Segregation of duties can blur in modern workflows</h4>
        <p>
            Distribution roles can touch quoting, pricing, order entry, credits, returns, and customer communications.
            As AI is layered into workflows, evidence of “who did what” can become less clear if actions are not logged and attributable.
            Segregation of duties concerns shift into new interfaces, new permissions, and new automation pathways.
        </p>

        <h4>Drift and quiet change can weaken controls over time</h4>
        <p>
            Machine learning behavior can change as data patterns shift and operations evolve.
            Without monitoring and periodic revalidation, control performance can degrade while teams still believe controls are working.
            This is one of the key reasons audit should view AI as “living logic” that requires lifecycle oversight.
        </p>

        <h3>Why internal audit should be positioned as a partner</h3>
        <p>
            Internal audit is most effective when it helps the organization adopt AI responsibly and consistently.
            That partnership role includes translating emerging technology into control expectations leaders already understand:
            accountability, evidence, testing discipline, and monitoring. It also includes aligning AI initiatives with established governance
            and risk management practices rather than treating AI as a separate, informal track.
        </p>

        <p>
            The NIST AI Risk Management Framework is a useful reference because it emphasizes governance across the lifecycle of AI systems,
            including how organizations map, measure, and manage AI risks over time. Even when the organization does not build AI internally,
            those governance principles remain relevant for vendor features and embedded capabilities.
        </p>

        <h3>The governance best practice: an AI advisory board</h3>
        <p>
            For many organizations, especially those that are employee-owned and not publicly traded but still operate at enterprise scale,
            the most scalable best practice is an AI advisory board (or AI governance council) with clear decision rights.
            This is not about slowing innovation. It is about ensuring AI-enabled changes are risk-assessed, documented, tested, and monitored
            with the same discipline applied to other control-impacting changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Internal audit should be a standing member or formal advisor to the advisory board because audit is uniquely positioned to connect risks across functions.
            Many enterprise tools operate in silos. Audit’s end-to-end view supports pattern recognition across a full process, not just within one system.
            That end-to-end view is often what makes the difference between point fixes and durable risk reduction.
        </p>

        <p>
            At minimum, the advisory board should include IT, cybersecurity, legal and privacy, risk or compliance, finance, and operations leadership.
            It should also define how vendor AI capabilities are assessed, not only internally built solutions.
            Emerging management-system standards such as ISO/IEC 42001 provide a helpful reference point for what structured AI governance can look like at scale.
        </p>

        <h3>A control mapping example audit teams can reuse</h3>
        <p>
            A practical way to make AI governance real is to map AI-enabled use cases to existing control objectives, then define what must change.
            This approach modernizes the control matrix without rewriting it from scratch.

        <h3>What internal audit should be building now</h3>
        <p>
            Internal audit credibility comes from practicality. The goal is not to audit “AI” as a concept.
            The goal is to audit how AI changes risk in the organization’s most important workflows.
            A strong foundation includes baseline AI fluency, updated audit procedures, cross-functional collaboration,
            and the ability to analyze end-to-end data across systems.
        </p>

        <h4>Training and capability expectations</h4>
        <p>
            A reasonable target for most internal audit teams is a tiered training model: baseline fluency for all auditors,
            working proficiency for audit leads, and deeper capability for a small group who can partner with technology teams.
            Training should include common failure modes such as hallucinations, drift, and bias, along with how AI is embedded in enterprise platforms
            and what governance artifacts are reasonable to request.
        </p>

        <h4>Audit procedures and evidence expectations</h4>
        <p>
            Audit programs should evolve in familiar ways: clearer control design requirements, stronger evidence retention,
            and testing procedures that address change over time. Examples include expanding risk assessments to include vendor AI features,
            updating control matrices to reflect AI touchpoints, validating access controls, and reviewing configuration change management.
        </p>

        <h4>Data access as a prerequisite for credible assurance</h4>
        <p>
            As AI-enabled workflows scale, internal audit’s ability to provide assurance increasingly depends on data availability.
            In modern internal auditing, it is common for audit functions to require access to system data needed for testing,
            investigation support, and control validation, subject to confidentiality and appropriate safeguards.
            Without sufficient data access, audit coverage can become sampling-heavy and reactive, which limits the ability to identify patterns,
            validate control effectiveness, and troubleshoot issues quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
            In distribution environments, that data need is amplified by scale and process complexity.
            Strong audit partnerships typically include clear protocols for audit data access, data extraction support, and consistent definitions,
            so testing can be performed efficiently across locations, systems, and end-to-end workflows.
        </p>

        <h4>Scaling audit coverage in a cross-silo environment</h4>
        <p>
            Many organizations now operate with data distributed across multiple platforms, such as ERP, expense management, corporate cards,
            procurement, and workflow tools. Risks can span these systems, even when ownership and reporting are siloed.
            Internal audit can add meaningful value by using analytics and responsible AI assistance to connect signals across systems, identify
            anomalies at scale, and improve coverage without relying solely on small samples.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over time, audit functions often adopt approaches that bring key financial and operational data into a more unified testing view.
            When that consolidation is paired with analytics and automation, audit can better detect patterns that are not visible within a single system,
            and can perform faster root-cause analysis when issues occur. Later posts will explore what this can look like in practice, including examples
            of audit analytics that span multiple source systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Where to start</h3>
        <p>
            If you are new to this topic as an internal audit function or leadership team, start with three actions that build confidence:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Establish an AI advisory board</strong> and define decision rights, evidence expectations, and monitoring requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Create an AI capability inventory</strong> that includes vendor platform features, not only internal pilots.</li>
            <li><strong>Refresh the control matrix for high-impact workflows</strong> where AI influences decisions, transactions, or customer interactions.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Done well, this positioning builds trust. It signals that internal audit is enabling responsible adoption,
            protecting customer experience, and helping leadership scale AI with confidence.
            If this introduction resonates, the next posts will go deeper into governance structures, audit procedures, and how to operationalize
            testing at scale in a cross-silo technology environment.
