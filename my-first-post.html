    <h2>Internal Audit’s Role in an AI-Enabled Operating Model</h2>
    <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

    <p>
        AI-enabled capabilities are increasingly embedded in day-to-day operations, not only as standalone initiatives,
        but also through features baked into the software platforms the business already relies on. In operations-heavy
        environments like electrical and communications distribution, these capabilities can influence pricing, quoting,
        inventory planning, logistics, credit decisions, and customer communications. That influence is often fast,
        scalable, and difficult to notice if governance and evidence expectations are not defined up front.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is where internal audit matters. Audit’s value is not limited to reviewing outcomes after the fact.
        In an AI-enabled operating model, audit helps leadership maintain confidence that control design, evidence,
        and monitoring remain aligned as logic evolves across systems, teams, and vendors.
    </p>

    />
    <p class="image-caption">
        AI-enabled logic can influence operational and financial outcomes, which makes governance and assurance an internal control priority.
    </p>

    <h3>What is changing in the operating model</h3>
    <p>
        Traditional automation is usually deterministic. A script runs the same way until a change is introduced through code or configuration.
        Many AI-enabled capabilities behave differently. Machine learning outputs can shift as inputs, usage patterns, thresholds,
        permissions, and vendor releases change. In practical terms, decision logic can evolve without the type of discrete change event
        internal control frameworks were built around.
    </p>

    <p>
        This distinction matters because control effectiveness cannot be assumed to remain static. When AI is involved in workflows that
        influence financial outcomes, customer commitments, or approvals, the control environment has to address both initial design and
        ongoing change over time.
    </p>

    <h3>Why this matters in operational distribution</h3>
    <p>
        Operational distribution organizations manage high transaction volumes, thin margins, and tight service expectations.
        Decisions related to pricing, inventory allocation, credit, fulfillment, and customer commitments are tightly connected.
        AI-enabled features can improve speed and consistency, but they can also introduce quiet downstream impacts if governance and controls
        do not keep pace.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is also a customer-facing dimension. AI may contribute to customer communications, quote responses,
        shipment updates, and service interactions. When AI is part of customer touchpoints, oversight supports service quality,
        brand trust, and consistency with contract expectations.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        AI adoption scales quickly. Assurance has to scale with it.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>The industry-standard role internal audit should play</h3>
    <p>
        Internal audit has an established responsibility to evaluate governance, risk management, and controls across significant activities.
        As AI becomes embedded in operational and financial workflows, it becomes part of the control environment that audit is expected to cover.
        The question is not whether audit should be involved. The question is how audit modernizes its approach to provide reliable assurance
        in processes where logic, access paths, and vendor capabilities can change over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        In practice, internal audit adds value by helping leadership define expectations that are durable and testable:
        who is accountable, what evidence is retained, how changes are approved, how performance is monitored, and how issues are investigated.
        That is assurance work, and it is also enablement for responsible adoption.
    </p>

    <h3>What internal audit needs to understand</h3>
    <p>
        A strong starting point is understanding where AI influences decisions and actions across end-to-end workflows.
        This includes AI features embedded in third-party platforms, configuration-based capabilities enabled by administrators,
        and employee adoption of AI assistants to create analytics, scripts, and automation logic.
    </p>

    <p>
        Internal audit should also recognize that AI risk does not always arrive through a formally announced pilot.
        It can enter through software upgrades, new “assistant” features, plug-ins, integrations, and workflow automations.
        For the systems the business depends on, understanding vendor AI roadmaps and new features is increasingly part of maintaining an
        accurate risk assessment.
    </p>

    <h3>What internal audit should monitor beyond “AI projects”</h3>
    <p>
        A practical approach is to start with high-impact workflows and map where AI can influence them. Consider the following audit lenses:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data inputs and quality:</strong> what data is used, what is excluded, and how quality and lineage are validated</li>
        <li><strong>Decision points:</strong> where recommendations influence pricing, inventory, credit, purchasing, or customer commitments</li>
        <li><strong>Automation points:</strong> where AI output triggers actions, not just analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Access and change paths:</strong> who can change prompts, thresholds, connectors, permissions, or feature toggles</li>
        <li><strong>Vendor updates:</strong> changes introduced through release notes, upgrades, and newly enabled AI features</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence expectations:</strong> what logs, approvals, and monitoring outputs exist to support auditability</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where risk tends to surface first</h3>
    <p>
        The risks are often familiar, but they appear in new forms and at greater speed.
        Fraud risk can increase as AI reduces the effort required to generate convincing narratives, manipulate information,
        or accelerate social engineering. Segregation of duties can become less visible if AI-assisted workflows obscure who initiated,
        reviewed, approved, or executed an action, especially when audit trails are incomplete.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another common risk is quiet degradation. As AI-enabled logic evolves, performance can drift without clear signals.
        Controls that once worked may no longer operate as intended if monitoring and periodic revalidation are not built into governance practices.
        This is why assurance shifts toward lifecycle oversight rather than one-time validation.
    </p>

    <h3>What internal audit functions should be building now</h3>

    <h4>Training and capability development</h4>
    <p>
        As AI becomes part of the operating environment, internal audit teams benefit from developing baseline fluency across the function
        and deeper working knowledge among audit leaders. This includes understanding how AI is embedded in enterprise platforms,
        common risk patterns such as drift or over-reliance on generated output, and what constitutes reasonable evidence in AI-enabled workflows.
    </p>

    <p>
        It also includes knowing how employees could misuse AI for malicious purposes, and how those behaviors may show up in system logs,
        access patterns, exceptions, or workflow metadata. Practical capability development enables auditors to design relevant procedures,
        ask better questions, and collaborate credibly with cybersecurity, IT, legal, HR, finance, and operations.
    </p>

    <h4>Audit methodology updates</h4>
    <p>
        Audit programs should evolve in familiar ways: clearer control design requirements, stronger evidence retention,
        and testing procedures that address change over time. Examples include expanding risk assessments to include vendor AI features,
        updating control matrices to reflect AI touchpoints, validating access controls and configuration change management,
        and ensuring that monitoring and revalidation are defined for AI-influenced workflows.
    </p>

    <h4>Scaling coverage through analytics and smarter testing</h4>
    <p>
        Many organizations operate with data distributed across multiple platforms such as ERP, expense management, corporate card programs,
        procurement tools, and workflow systems. Risks can span these systems even when ownership and reporting are siloed.
        Internal audit can increase coverage and relevance by using analytics to connect signals across systems, identify anomalies at scale,
        and perform faster root-cause analysis when issues occur.
    </p>

    <p>
        As this series continues, later posts will explore what scaling audit coverage can look like in practice, including cross-silo analytics approaches
        and examples of how audit teams can modernize testing without relying solely on small samples.
    </p>

    <h3>A governance best practice that supports consistency</h3>
    <p>
        A widely adopted best practice is establishing an AI advisory board or governance council.
        This structure creates a consistent forum to evaluate AI-enabled changes, including those introduced through third-party platforms,
        against agreed-upon risk, control, and documentation standards. It also helps ensure that ownership and accountability remain clear
        as AI capabilities expand across the enterprise.
    </p>

    <p>
        Internal audit participation supports cross-functional alignment. Audit brings an end-to-end view that helps identify patterns across systems
        that individual teams may not see. This perspective is especially valuable in environments where workflows cross multiple platforms.
        Emerging management system standards such as ISO/IEC 42001 provide a useful reference point for structured AI governance at scale.
    </p>

    <h3>Control mapping example audit teams can reuse</h3>
    <p>
        A practical way to make AI governance operational is to map AI-enabled use cases to existing control objectives, then define what must change.
        This modernizes the control matrix without rewriting it from scratch.
    </p>

                <td>AI summarizes variances or drafts management commentary</td>
                <td>Financial reporting remains accurate and reviewable</td>

                <td>Inspect traceability, verify reviewer sign-off, test completeness of inputs</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Data access as a foundation for credible assurance</h3>
    <p>
        As processes become more data-driven, effective assurance increasingly depends on access to relevant data.
        Industry-standard internal audit practices typically include access to system data necessary to perform testing,
        investigate anomalies, and validate control operation, subject to appropriate safeguards.
        In high-volume operational environments, this access enables broader coverage, stronger pattern recognition,
        and faster issue resolution.
    </p>

    <h3>Where to start</h3>
    <p>
        For internal audit functions and leadership teams building confidence in an AI-enabled operating model, three practical actions create momentum:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Establish an AI advisory board</strong> and define decision rights, evidence expectations, and monitoring requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Create an AI capability inventory</strong> that includes vendor platform features, not only internal pilots.</li>
        <li><strong>Refresh the control matrix for high-impact workflows</strong> where AI influences decisions, transactions, or customer interactions.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        When these foundations are in place, AI adoption becomes easier to govern, easier to test, and easier to trust.
        The next posts will build from this baseline into governance structures, audit procedure updates, and scalable testing approaches
        suitable for cross-silo enterprise environments.
