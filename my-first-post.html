            <h2>AI Coding Assistants Are Becoming Control-Critical Tools in Operational Industries</h2>
            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

            <p>
                Across operations-heavy industries, AI coding assistants are moving from “developer convenience” to “business-critical capability.”
                Teams use tools like Microsoft Copilot and Claude to accelerate analytics, automate workflow scripts, generate SQL, and draft system logic
                that touches purchasing, pricing, inventory, logistics, credit, and financial reporting. In electrical and communications distribution,
                that matters because small logic changes can scale quickly across thousands of SKUs, customers, locations, and transactions.
            </p>

            <p>
                This post is the starting point for the series. It introduces what is changing, why it matters to leadership and internal audit,
                what internal audit needs to understand to keep pace, and what good governance looks like in practice.
                The short version is this: AI-enabled logic is not always static, and controls that were designed for traditional scripts and systems
                can weaken over time if organizations do not manage AI like a living control-impacting capability.
            </p>

            />
            <p class="image-caption">
                AI-assisted logic can influence operational decisions and financial outcomes, which makes governance and control design a core assurance issue.
            </p>

            <h3>A subtle shift with outsized impact</h3>
            <p>
                Traditional automation tends to be deterministic. A script runs the same way until someone changes it.
                AI-enabled solutions, including machine learning and agent-style workflows, can evolve through configuration changes,
                model updates, new data inputs, and vendor feature releases. In other words, the “logic” can move even when no one
                thinks they are changing a control-relevant process.
            </p>

            <p>
                That evolution is not inherently bad. In fact, competitors in the distribution space are investing heavily in digital transformation,
                analytics, and AI-enabled operations to improve productivity and customer experience. The point for leadership is that AI value and AI risk
                scale together. The point for internal audit is that the control environment must scale with them.
            </p>

            <h3>Why leadership should care</h3>
            <p>
                In distribution, operational decisions quickly become financial outcomes. Inventory optimization affects working capital.
                Pricing logic affects margin. Delivery promises affect customer experience and retention. Quote turnaround affects win rates.
                When AI is used to draft, modify, or recommend logic within those workflows, there can be downstream financial control implications
                even if the change began as “just analytics” or “just a productivity tool.”
            </p>

            <p>
                There is also a customer-facing angle that is easy to miss. As organizations experiment with AI agents or AI-assisted communications,
                these tools can influence customer interactions directly through chat, email drafting, ticket responses, and quoting support.
                That means the stakes include not only control effectiveness and compliance, but also brand trust and customer experience.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                A practical governance mindset: AI is not a one-time implementation. It is a capability that requires ongoing oversight, monitoring, and reassessment.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>What internal audit needs to understand</h3>
            <p>
                Internal audit does not need to become a team of data scientists to add value. But audit does need a working understanding of how AI shows up in the business,
                including where it is embedded quietly. Many third-party software vendors are adding AI features directly into their platforms,
                so risk is not limited to internally built models or formally announced pilots. If the business uses the software, the business may be using AI,
                sometimes without calling it that.
            </p>

            <p>
                That is why internal audit should expand its inventory beyond “AI projects” and also track AI-enabled functionality in major systems and tools.
                The most practical approach is to focus on the workflows that matter, then identify where AI can influence those workflows through:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data inputs:</strong> what data is used, what is excluded, and how data quality is validated</li>
                <li><strong>Decision points:</strong> where recommendations or classifications affect pricing, procurement, inventory, or customer commitments</li>
                <li><strong>Automation points:</strong> where AI-generated outputs are used to execute actions, not just inform humans</li>
                <li><strong>Change drivers:</strong> who can change prompts, configurations, thresholds, connectors, or permissions</li>
                <li><strong>Vendor updates:</strong> what changes when the vendor pushes new AI features or model upgrades</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Where the risks show up first</h3>
            <p>
                This topic is persuasive without being alarmist because the risks are familiar, but they appear in new forms.
                Internal audit already knows how weak controls lead to losses, errors, and operational breakdowns.
                AI simply changes the speed, scale, and visibility of those control failures.
            </p>

            <h4>Fraud and misuse risks increase with capability</h4>
            <p>
                AI can reduce effort required to generate convincing messages, manipulate information, or bypass basic review processes.
                Fraud also becomes easier to disguise when teams rely heavily on auto-generated narratives, summaries, or exception explanations.
                Occupational fraud remains a material risk for organizations, and AI can amplify both opportunity and concealment.
            </p>

            <h4>Segregation of duties can blur in modern workflows</h4>
            <p>
                In distribution environments, a single role might touch quoting, pricing, order management, credits, returns, and customer communication.
                As AI is layered into these workflows, the “who did what” evidence trail can get less clear if AI actions and AI-assisted decisions
                are not logged and attributable. SOD concerns do not disappear. They shift into new interfaces and new permission models.
            </p>

            <h4>“Model drift” and input drift can quietly impact financial outcomes</h4>
            <p>
                Leadership often expects automation to behave consistently. Machine learning is different.
                As data patterns shift, customer mix changes, and operational constraints evolve, model outputs can change as well.
                Without monitoring and periodic revalidation, control performance can degrade while the organization still believes controls are working.
            </p>

            <h3>The governance best practice: an AI advisory board</h3>
            <p>
                For most organizations, especially those that are not publicly traded but still operate at enterprise scale, the most credible and scalable approach
                is an AI advisory board (or AI governance council) with clear decision rights. This is not about slowing innovation.
                It is about ensuring that AI-enabled changes are risk-assessed, documented, tested, and monitored with the same discipline as other control-impacting changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Internal audit should be a standing member or formal advisor to that board because audit is uniquely positioned to connect risks across functions.
                Operational teams often work in silos by necessity, and many tools create siloed logs and siloed analytics. Audit brings the end-to-end view.
                That end-to-end view is what enables pattern recognition across a full process, not just within one system.
            </p>

            <p>
                At minimum, the advisory board should include leaders from IT, cybersecurity, legal and privacy, risk or compliance, finance,
                and key operations groups. It should also define how vendor AI capabilities are assessed, not only internally built solutions.
            </p>

            <h3>Control mapping example: translating AI risk into auditable controls</h3>
            <p>
                A practical way to make AI governance real is to map AI-enabled use cases to existing control objectives, then define what must change.
                Below is an example format internal audit teams can use to update the control matrix without rewriting everything from scratch.
            </p>

            <table class="grid-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Workflow touchpoint</th>
                        <th>AI-enabled change</th>
                        <th>Control objective</th>

                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Pricing and margin management</td>
                        <td>AI suggests price adjustments or discount guidance</td>
                        <td>Prices align to approved policy and delegation of authority</td>

                        <td>Order entry and customer communications</td>
                        <td>AI drafts customer-facing responses or resolves tickets</td>
                        <td>Customer commitments are accurate and consistent with policy</td>
                        <td>Require approved templates, restricted actions, and retention of AI interaction logs</td>
                        <td>Test ticket samples, verify response accuracy, verify audit trail and retention settings</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                        <td>AI forecasts demand and influences replenishment</td>
                        <td>Inventory decisions are explainable and monitored for bias or drift</td>
                        <td>Define monitoring metrics, periodic revalidation cadence, and data quality controls</td>
                        <td>Review monitoring dashboards, drift alerts, data pipeline controls, and revalidation records</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Finance close and reporting</td>
                        <td>AI summarizes variances or drafts management commentary</td>
                        <td>Financial reporting remains accurate and reviewable</td>
                        <td>Require human review, source traceability, and limits on auto-generated narrative use</td>
                        <td>Inspect source-to-summary trace, confirm reviewer sign-off, test completeness of inputs</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>What internal audit functions should be considering now</h3>
            <p>
                Internal audit credibility in this space comes from practicality. The goal is not to audit “AI” as a concept.
                The goal is to audit how AI changes the risk profile of the organization’s most important workflows.
                That requires three categories of capability: baseline AI fluency, updated audit procedures, and cross-functional collaboration.
            </p>

            <h4>1) Baseline AI fluency and training expectations</h4>
            <p>
                Internal auditors should build a working understanding of AI fundamentals: what machine learning is, what generative AI does,
                what an “agent” is in an enterprise context, and what common failure modes look like (hallucinations, drift, bias, and weak data lineage).
                A practical training target is the ability to ask the right questions, evaluate governance artifacts, and recognize when specialists are needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                A strong starting set of reference frameworks includes the NIST AI Risk Management Framework for risk language and structure,
                and emerging management system standards such as ISO/IEC 42001 for how organizations operationalize AI governance.
                Internal audit can use these frameworks to align expectations without reinventing the wheel.
            </p>

            <h4>2) Updating the audit approach and testing procedures</h4>
            <p>
                Audit programs and testing procedures should evolve in ways that feel familiar to leadership: controls, evidence, and repeatability.
                Examples of practical adjustments include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Expand risk assessment procedures</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Include AI-enabled features in major systems and vendor platforms used by operations and finance</li>
                        <li>Identify where AI outputs drive decisions or execute actions, not just inform humans</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Update control matrices</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Map AI touchpoints to existing control objectives and define what new evidence is required</li>
                        <li>Add monitoring controls where drift or continuous learning is relevant</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Modernize evidence expectations</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Require logs and traceability for AI outputs used in operational or financial decisions</li>
                        <li>Confirm access controls, configuration management, and change management around AI settings and connectors</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3) Staying ahead of fraud and malicious use</h4>
            <p>
                Fraud risk is not new, but AI changes the tactics and the speed.
                Internal audit should partner with cybersecurity, legal, HR, and operations to stay aware of how AI could be used for social engineering,
                vendor manipulation, identity fraud, and bypassing review workflows. This is also an area where internal audit can be constructive:
                strengthening preventative controls and detective monitoring helps protect both employees and customers.
            </p>

            <h4>4) Using AI to scale internal audit responsibly</h4>
            <p>
                Audit teams should also consider how AI can enhance audit coverage and scale, especially in complex distribution environments.
                Even at a high level, leadership should understand that audit can use modern analytics and automation to expand testing scope,
                detect patterns across systems, and identify anomalies in near real time. This is not about replacing judgment.
                It is about extending it across larger populations and across process silos.
            </p>

            <p>
                Later posts will go deeper into tools and implementation. For now, the key message is that internal audit should build a deliberate strategy
                for AI-enabled audit work, including guardrails, validation, and documentation so audit’s own use of AI remains defensible and repeatable.
            </p>

            <h3>Where to start this week</h3>
            <p>
                If you are new to this topic as an internal audit function, start with three concrete steps:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Stand up an AI advisory board</strong> with internal audit as a standing member or formal advisor.</li>
                <li><strong>Create an AI capability inventory</strong> that includes vendor platform features, not only internal pilots.</li>
                <li><strong>Refresh the control matrix</strong> for the highest-impact workflows where AI influences decisions or customer interactions.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Done well, this positioning builds trust with leadership. It signals that internal audit is enabling responsible adoption,
                protecting customer experience, and helping the organization scale with confidence.
            </p>
