        <h2>AI Coding Assistants Are Becoming Control-Critical Tools in Operational Industries</h2>
        <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

        <p>
            AI coding assistants and agent-enabled tools are increasingly integrated into enterprise operations,
            supporting analytics, automation, reporting logic, and customer-facing workflows. What often begins as
            productivity support for developers or analysts can quickly evolve into logic that directly influences
            operational decisions, financial outcomes, and customer experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            In operational industries such as electrical and communications distribution, where organizations manage
            high transaction volumes, complex supply chains, and narrow margins, these tools are no longer peripheral.
            They are becoming embedded in the systems and processes that internal controls are designed to support.
        </p>

        <p class="image-caption">
            As AI-assisted logic becomes embedded in operational systems, its influence on controls and outcomes expands.
        </p>

        <h3>How AI-enabled tools are reshaping operational processes</h3>
        <p>
            Traditional automation relies on deterministic logic that executes the same instructions consistently over
            time. In contrast, many AI-enabled tools rely on machine learning techniques that adapt based on data inputs,
            usage patterns, and evolving data sets. As a result, the logic influencing decisions is not static.
        </p>

        <p>
            In distribution environments, AI-assisted logic may support demand forecasting, pricing analysis,
            transportation routing, inventory replenishment, or customer service responses. As these tools learn and
            adjust, outcomes can change even when the underlying business intent remains unchanged.
        </p>

        <p>
            Industry groups such as the National Association of Electrical Distributors have highlighted the growing
            role of advanced analytics and automation in managing scale, service levels, and profitability. As AI
            becomes part of this analytical layer, it introduces new considerations for how controls are designed and
            monitored.
        </p>

        <h3>Strategic implications for organizational leadership</h3>
        <p>
            From a leadership perspective, the key consideration is not whether AI should be used, but how its use is
            governed as it scales across the organization. Machine learning models are only as reliable as the data
            they consume and the controls that guide how they evolve.
        </p>

        <p>
            In practice, pricing recommendations, fulfillment decisions, or customer communications may shift over time
            based on changing inputs. Without clear governance and monitoring, these changes can affect margins, revenue
            timing, contractual commitments, and customer trust.
        </p>

        <p>
            AI agents are also increasingly capable of interacting directly with customers through chat, order
            assistance, and service workflows. These interactions shape customer experience and brand perception,
            particularly when behavior evolves dynamically rather than following predefined scripts.
        </p>

        <h3>Internal audit’s role in a changing control environment</h3>
        <p>
            Internal audit is uniquely positioned to help organizations understand how emerging technologies fit within
            the overall control environment. Professional standards issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors require
            audit functions to evaluate governance, risk management, and internal controls across significant activities,
            including those enabled by advanced technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            As AI-enabled tools influence operational and financial processes, audit responsibilities extend beyond
            validating outcomes. Audit teams must understand how AI-assisted logic is designed, how changes are approved
            and tested, how segregation of duties is preserved, and how evidence is retained to support assurance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Frameworks such as the COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework emphasize accountability, documentation,
            and ongoing monitoring. AI-enabled processes challenge traditional interpretations of these principles if
            control design and testing approaches are not adapted accordingly.
        </p>

        <h3>Capabilities internal audit functions should build now</h3>

        <p>
            For internal audit teams, the goal is not to become data scientists. The goal is to build enough fluency to
            evaluate whether AI-enabled processes are governed, controlled, and monitored in a way that supports
            operational integrity, financial reliability, and customer trust. The Institute of Internal Auditors has
            published an AI Auditing Framework intended to help internal auditors evaluate AI governance and risk across
            its lifecycle, and it is a strong reference point for how the profession is formalizing expectations.
        </p>

        <h4>Training expectations: a practical ladder</h4>
        <p>
            A useful approach is to define a shared baseline for the team, then build deeper capability for a smaller
            group who will lead testing design and advisory work. Many internal audit functions are using a tiered model:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Baseline fluency for all auditors:</strong> Core concepts such as machine learning versus
                rules-based automation, what large language models do well and do poorly, how hallucinations and bias can
                appear, and why outputs change when inputs change.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Working proficiency for audit leads:</strong> Understanding AI lifecycle concepts such as training
                data, model updates, monitoring, human oversight, and change management. This level should include the
                ability to interpret AI governance artifacts, such as model documentation, validation summaries, and
                approval evidence.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Advanced capability for a small specialist group:</strong> Ability to partner with IT and data
                teams on more technical topics such as model risk indicators, testing approaches, access and logging
                design, and continuous monitoring strategies.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The IIA’s learning curriculum on auditing in the age of AI is also a practical way to standardize baseline
            terminology and risks across the team. Separately, NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework is useful for audit
            leaders because it lays out a governance-oriented structure that is applicable even when AI is not built in
            house. NIST organizes AI risk management around four high-level functions: govern, map, measure, and manage.
        </p>

        <h4>What internal audit should add to the risk assessment</h4>
        <p>
            Audit risk assessment and planning should explicitly consider where AI is being used across the enterprise,
            including areas that may not be labeled as “AI projects.” In distribution, AI can appear inside pricing and
            margin analysis, order and quote workflows, inventory planning, logistics, customer support, and analytics.
            Internal audit should focus on where AI outputs have the ability to influence decisions at scale, especially
            when those decisions flow into financial processes.
        </p>

        <p>
            The assessment should also consider whether AI is being used in silos. When analytics and automation are
            fragmented across separate tools, teams can lose end-to-end visibility across a full process. That is where
            internal audit can create value by mapping the process holistically and identifying where controls and
            evidence do not align with how work is actually occurring.
        </p>

        <h4>Fraud and misconduct: how AI changes the threat model</h4>
        <p>
            AI increases fraud and misconduct risk because it lowers the effort required to execute deception, scale
            social engineering, and generate convincing artifacts. This includes more persuasive phishing attempts,
            deepfake audio or video impersonation, synthetic documentation, and faster iteration on schemes that exploit
            process gaps. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners consistently emphasizes that control weaknesses
            create opportunity for occupational fraud, and that prevention and detection rely heavily on strong controls
            and monitoring.
        </p>

        <p>
            For operational distribution organizations, internal audit should watch for AI-enabled misuse patterns that
            map to real business processes, such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Procure-to-pay fraud:</strong> Faster creation of convincing vendor communications, invoices, or
                change requests, especially when combined with compromised email accounts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Customer credit and refunds:</strong> Social engineering that uses AI-generated narratives and
                documentation to pressure exceptions, credits, or write-offs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pricing manipulation:</strong> AI-assisted analysis used to identify control gaps and exploit
                override paths, especially when approvals are inconsistent across locations or segments.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Access misuse and segregation of duties compression:</strong> AI-enabled automation that allows
                one role to perform tasks that used to require separate roles, reducing compensating review.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Internal audit does not have to predict every scheme. The practical focus is to identify which processes are
            exception-prone, which rely on judgment, and which are vulnerable to identity and authorization weaknesses.
            Then, audit can recommend governance and controls that make exploitation harder and detection faster.
        </p>

        <h4>How internal audit can use AI to expand scope and scale</h4>
        <p>
            Audit teams can also use AI to strengthen assurance. The most valuable use cases typically support scale,
            coverage, and speed, while keeping humans accountable for conclusions. High-level examples include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Scoping and planning support:</strong> Summarizing policies, process documentation, and prior
                audit results to accelerate understanding and identify likely risk themes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Testing acceleration:</strong> Assisting with test design, sampling logic, and documentation
                templates that improve consistency across auditors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pattern recognition:</strong> Helping audit teams explore anomaly clusters, exceptions, and
                behavior-based signals across large transaction sets, especially where legacy tooling is siloed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Continuous monitoring concepts:</strong> Supporting the design of repeatable monitoring routines
                that can be run more frequently than traditional audit cycles.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The key governance principle is that internal audit should treat its own AI use as a control-relevant
            capability. This includes clarifying acceptable use, maintaining confidentiality expectations, and retaining
            evidence that supports audit conclusions. These themes align with both the IIA AI Auditing Framework and
            NIST’s emphasis on lifecycle governance and monitoring.
        </p>

        <h4>Who audit should collaborate with</h4>
        <p>
            To navigate this shifting business model, internal audit should maintain an active working relationship with:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>IT and cybersecurity:</strong> Identity, access, logging, vendor risk, and incident response.</li>
            <li><strong>Data and analytics teams:</strong> Data quality, lineage, model monitoring, and change management.</li>
            <li><strong>Operations leadership:</strong> Process reality, exception drivers, and control feasibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Downstream impacts to financial reporting, accruals, pricing, and revenue timing.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal and compliance:</strong> Contract commitments, customer communications, and regulatory considerations.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer-facing functions:</strong> Service quality, escalation patterns, and agent behavior in the field.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This collaboration is where internal audit becomes most valuable to leadership. Audit can help connect
            operational reality, technology risk, and control expectations across the full process rather than reviewing
            issues after they become visible.
        </p>

        <h3>Establishing governance through an AI advisory board</h3>
        <p>
            Many organizations are responding to these challenges by establishing cross-functional AI advisory boards.
            These groups bring together operations, IT, legal, compliance, risk management, and internal audit to provide
            shared oversight and alignment.
        </p>

        <p>
            An advisory board supports consistent expectations for acceptable use, testing standards, documentation, and
            ongoing monitoring. It also ensures that internal audit is engaged as a strategic partner rather than
            introduced after issues emerge.
        </p>

        <p>
            ISO/IEC 42001 is also emerging as a relevant governance reference point because it specifies requirements for
            an AI management system and emphasizes lifecycle oversight. Even when an organization is not pursuing formal
            certification, the standard helps frame what “managed AI” can look like at scale.
        </p>

        <h3>Control considerations in the absence of audit involvement</h3>
        <p>
            When internal audit is not engaged, organizations may find it difficult to identify when AI-driven logic
            begins to influence downstream financial controls. Changes in model behavior can affect pricing, accruals,
            inventory valuation, or revenue timing without clear visibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over time, undocumented automation, compressed segregation of duties, and inconsistent testing practices can
            reduce confidence in reported results and increase the cost of remediation.
        </p>

        <h3>Building a foundation for responsible AI adoption</h3>
        <p>
            AI coding assistants and agents are becoming integral to operational industries. Recognizing them as
            control-relevant tools is a necessary step toward responsible adoption.
        </p>

        <p>
            This post establishes a foundation for future discussions on governance models, audit testing approaches, and
            tools that support scalable, compliant, and well-controlled AI use across the enterprise.
