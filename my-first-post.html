        <h2>AI Coding Assistants Are Becoming Control-Critical Tools in Operational Industries</h2>
        <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

        <p>
            AI coding assistants and agent-enabled tools are increasingly embedded in how operational and analytical work
            is performed across enterprise environments. What often begins as productivity support for developers,
            analysts, or operations teams can quickly evolve into logic that influences pricing analysis, inventory
            optimization, logistics planning, customer communication, and financial reporting.
        </p>

        <p>
            In operational industries such as electrical and communications distribution, where scale, margin pressure,
            and process complexity are defining characteristics, these tools are no longer peripheral. They are becoming
            control-relevant components of how the business operates.

            AI-enabled logic increasingly influences operational and financial outcomes, making governance and control
            design critical.
        </p>

        <h3>What is changing with AI-enabled tools</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional scripts or deterministic automation, many AI-enabled tools rely on machine learning
            techniques that adapt based on data inputs, usage patterns, and feedback loops. This means the logic
            supporting decisions and workflows is not static.
        </p>

        <p>
            As models evolve, outcomes can shift even when the original business intent remains unchanged. In a
            high-volume distribution environment, small changes can scale rapidly across thousands of transactions.
        </p>

        <h3>Why leadership should care</h3>
        <p>
            From a leadership perspective, the risk is not that AI exists, but that it influences operational and
            financial outcomes in ways that are not fully understood or monitored. Machine learning models are only as
            reliable as the data they consume and the controls that surround them.
        </p>

        <p>
            AI agents increasingly interact directly with customers through chat, order support, and service workflows.
            These interactions affect customer experience, consistency, and trust, particularly when behavior evolves
            over time.
        </p>

        <h3>Why internal audit plays a critical role</h3>
        <p>
            Internal audit’s role is to help organizations understand how emerging tools fit within the control
            environment. Professional standards require internal audit to evaluate governance, risk management, and
            internal controls across all significant activities, including those enabled by advanced technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            This includes evaluating how AI-assisted logic is designed, how changes are validated, how segregation of
            duties is maintained, and how evidence is retained for assurance purposes.
