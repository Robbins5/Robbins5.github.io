            <h2>AI Coding Assistants Are Becoming Control-Critical Tools in Operational Industries</h2>
            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

            <p>
                AI coding assistants such as Claude and Microsoft Copilot are increasingly being used to support
                analytics, automation, and system logic across enterprise environments. These tools are often adopted
                first for productivity, but in practice they influence how code is drafted, how data is transformed,
                and how automated workflows are created. As adoption expands, coding assistants are becoming part of
                how operational and financial outcomes are produced.
            </p>

            <h3>What is happening in operational distribution environments</h3>
            <p>
                In electrical and communications or data distribution, there is a constant push to improve speed,
                accuracy, and responsiveness across pricing, inventory visibility, fulfillment, and service. AI-enabled
                tools can support these needs by helping teams build scripts, formulas, queries, and automation that
                accelerate analysis and reduce manual effort. AI agents are also beginning to interact directly with
                customers through chat and service workflows, influencing customer experience through the accuracy,
                consistency, and tone of responses.
            </p>

            <p>
                As organizations pilot these tools, adoption often spreads through local efficiency initiatives and
                proofs of concept. This is a normal path for innovation, but it also means AI-enabled logic can become
                embedded in day-to-day workflows before documentation, review expectations, and accountability are
                standardized.
            </p>

                AI-assisted logic can influence operational and financial outcomes, making shared visibility and clear control expectations increasingly important.
            </p>

            <h3>Why leadership should care</h3>
            <p>
                Distribution organizations operate at high volume, with complex pricing structures and margin pressure.
                Small logic changes can scale quickly, influencing analytics outputs, operational decisions, and
                financial reporting. As AI-enabled tools contribute to scripts, transformations, and automation, leaders
                are increasingly focusing on how these capabilities fit within existing expectations for accuracy,
                accountability, and consistency.
            </p>

            <p>
                When AI agents communicate with customers, the impact expands beyond internal efficiency. Customer trust
                can be influenced by whether information is correct, whether the experience is consistent, and whether
                service decisions align with established policy. These are business outcomes, not just technology
                outcomes.
            </p>

            <h3>Why internal audit involvement matters early</h3>
            <p>
                Internal audit is increasingly viewed as a strategic partner in responsible AI adoption. When involved
                early, audit can help identify where AI-enabled tools intersect with existing control assumptions,
                especially around documentation, accountability, validation, and segregation of duties. This supports
                scalable adoption by helping organizations anticipate control considerations while practices are still
                evolving.
            </p>

            <p>
                In practice, early audit engagement can be achieved through a seat at the table during design and pilot
                phases or through participation in an advisory structure. The goal is not for audit to own or approve AI
                initiatives. The goal is shared visibility and risk-aware decision-making so that AI-enabled workflows
                mature in a way that supports both efficiency and control expectations.
            </p>

            <h3>What emerging best practice looks like</h3>
            <p>
                Many organizations are building simple, cross-functional forums where operations, technology, risk,
                legal, and internal audit exchange perspectives as AI moves from experimentation into broader use. These
                forums are not approval gates. They help clarify ownership, define validation expectations, and align on
                how AI-enabled logic is documented and monitored.
            </p>

            <p>
                This approach aligns with established internal control principles that emphasize accountability and
                evidence. It also supports internal audit’s ability to provide relevant assurance as AI becomes part of
                the operating model.
            </p>

            <h3>What can change when audit is not engaged early</h3>
            <p>
                When audit involvement occurs later in the adoption lifecycle, organizations may trade speed for reduced
                visibility into how AI-enabled logic operates across processes. This can make it more difficult to
                explain outcomes, maintain segregation of duties assumptions, or ensure consistent customer interactions
                as usage scales.
            </p>

            <p>
                Organizations can also experience increased rework. When control expectations are clarified only after
                AI-enabled practices are already embedded, governance and documentation often need to be retrofitted.
                Earlier dialogue helps reduce the need for remediation and supports a smoother path to sustainable
                adoption.
            </p>

            <h3>Closing perspective</h3>
            <p>
                AI coding assistants and agents are becoming part of how work is performed in electrical and
                communications distribution. Recognizing their role within the control environment is a natural step in
                the evolution of enterprise AI use.
            </p>

            <p>
                For internal audit leaders, early awareness supports relevant assurance. For executive leadership, early
                audit involvement supports responsible adoption while preserving the speed and flexibility that make
                these tools valuable. Future posts will build on this foundation by exploring governance, testing
                approaches, and audit tooling considerations as AI adoption matures.
