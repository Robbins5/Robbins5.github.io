            <h2>AI Coding and Research Assistants Are Becoming Governance-Critical in Operational Industries</h2>
            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

            <p>
                This newsletter covers AI research tools and AI coding assistants through the lens of internal audit,
                data science, and enterprise governance. The focus is on how these tools are being adopted within
                asset-intensive, regulated industries such as electrical distribution and industrial supply, how they
                influence decision-making and internal controls, and what organizations and audit teams must put in
                place to manage AI-related risk responsibly.
            </p>

            <h3>AI Coding Assistants Are Becoming Control-Critical Tools in Operational Industries</h3>

            <p>
                AI coding assistants such as Claude and Microsoft Copilot are increasingly used to support analytics,
                automation, and system logic across enterprise environments. According to product documentation from
                Anthropic, Claude is designed to explain, refactor, and generate code for analytical and operational use
                cases. Microsoft similarly positions Copilot as an assistant embedded within enterprise platforms used
                for reporting, data analysis, and process automation.
            </p>

            <p>
                In operational industries like electrical distribution, even small changes to analytical logic can
                affect inventory planning, pricing decisions, logistics optimization, and financial reporting.
                Industry guidance from organizations such as the National Association of Electrical Distributors (NAED)
                highlights the growing reliance on advanced analytics and automation to manage complex supply chains and
                margin pressure. As AI contributes to this logic, the potential impact on internal controls increases.
            </p>

            <p>
                This development directly relates to Institute of Internal Auditors Standard 2130, which requires
                organizations to maintain effective internal controls, and to the COSO Internal Control – Integrated
                Framework, which emphasizes accountability and documentation for control activities. AI-assisted coding
                challenges both if governance expectations are not updated.
            </p>

            <p>
                My takeaway is that organizations should formally recognize AI coding assistants as control-impacting
                tools. Establishing AI advisory boards or cross-functional governance groups that include IT,
                operations, legal, risk, and audit can help define expectations for testing, documentation, and
                accountability. Internal audit teams must also upskill to understand how AI-generated logic is created
                and where control risks can emerge, particularly in systems that support core operational processes.
            </p>

            <h3>AI Research Tools Are Influencing Decision-Making Without Formal Oversight</h3>

            <p>
                AI research tools that summarize documents, synthesize information, and answer complex questions are
                increasingly used by leaders to navigate large volumes of operational and financial data. Vendor
                demonstrations and practitioner use cases show these tools acting as intermediaries between raw
                information and executive judgment, often without being formally designated as decision-support
                systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                In industries such as electrical distribution, leadership decisions rely heavily on accurate
                forecasting, supplier performance data, customer demand trends, and working capital metrics.
                Publications from Supply Chain Brain and NAED consistently emphasize the importance of timely and
                reliable information in managing supply chain volatility. When AI tools summarize or interpret this
                information, they influence what leaders see and prioritize.
            </p>

            <p>
                This trend intersects with IIA Standard 2120, which focuses on risk identification and assessment, and
                COSO principles related to the use of relevant and reliable information. If AI-generated insights are
                incomplete or biased, decision-making risk increases even if underlying data systems remain unchanged.
            </p>

            <p>
                What stands out is that many organizations have not yet established guidance for AI-assisted research
                and analysis. AI advisory boards can help define acceptable use cases, validation expectations, and
                disclosure requirements. Internal audit teams must adjust by expanding beyond traditional report
                reviews and developing the capability to assess how AI-generated insights influence risk awareness and
                operational decisions.
            </p>

            <h3>AI Governance Requires Industry-Specific Structures, Not Just Tool Approval</h3>

            <p>
                Many organizations have focused their AI governance efforts on approving specific tools, often those
                embedded within enterprise platforms, while restricting others. While this approach addresses vendor
                risk, it does not fully reflect how work is performed in practice. Employees frequently supplement
                approved tools with external AI platforms on personal devices to solve operational or analytical
                challenges more efficiently.
            </p>

            <p>
                In asset-intensive industries, this behavior introduces risks related to proprietary pricing models,
                supplier data, customer information, and operational strategy. Industry guidance from NAED and broader
                industrial distribution research shows that competitive advantage increasingly depends on data and
                analytics capabilities. Uncontrolled AI use can quietly expose this information.
            </p>

            <p>
                This challenge aligns with IIA Standard 2110, which focuses on governance, and IIA Standard 2100, which
                emphasizes risk management. COSO similarly recognizes that effective internal control depends on both
                formal policies and human behavior.
            </p>

            <p>
                The implication is that organizations need more mature AI governance structures, including advisory
                boards, clear accountability models, and targeted training tailored to industry-specific risks. For
                internal audit, this shift reinforces the need to evolve from a compliance-focused role to an advisory
                one. Audit teams that invest in AI literacy, understand operational workflows, and engage early in
                governance discussions will be better positioned to help organizations manage AI risk proactively
                rather than reactively.
            </p>
