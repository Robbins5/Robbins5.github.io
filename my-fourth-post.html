            <p>
                As AI tools and agent-based workflows become embedded in analytics, forecasting, automation, and
                decision support, internal audit teams are confronting a fundamental challenge: many traditional audit
                approaches were not designed for systems that learn, adapt, and influence decisions dynamically.
                Sampling outputs or validating static logic is no longer sufficient when AI contributes to how work is
                performed and decisions are made.
            </p>

            <p>
                In response, audit functions are beginning to shift their focus upstream. Rather than concentrating
                solely on results, audit teams are evaluating how AI-enabled processes are designed, governed, and
                monitored. This includes assessing data inputs, understanding model boundaries, evaluating human
                oversight, and determining where AI influences operational or financial decisions, even indirectly.
                In environments where agents automate tasks or recommend actions, audit attention is expanding to
                include orchestration logic, escalation rules, and exception handling.
            </p>

            <p>
                This evolution also requires new capabilities. Audit teams are investing in AI literacy so auditors can
                understand how models function at a conceptual level and identify where control risks may emerge. Some
                organizations are moving toward continuous or near-real-time monitoring models, recognizing that
                periodic reviews may miss emerging risks in adaptive systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                For corporate leadership, this shift matters because AI-related risk does not stem from technology
                alone, but from how it is deployed, governed, and relied upon. Internal audit’s evolving role is not to
                slow AI adoption, but to help ensure it is implemented responsibly. Early audit involvement, clear
                governance structures, and defined accountability can reduce the likelihood of control gaps, compliance
                surprises, and unintended decision-making risk as AI use continues to expand.
