            <h2>AI Research Tools Are Influencing Decision-Making Without Formal Oversight</h2>
            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

            <p>
                AI research tools that summarize documents, synthesize information, and answer complex questions are
                increasingly used by leaders to navigate large volumes of operational and financial data. Vendor
                demonstrations and practitioner use cases show these tools acting as intermediaries between raw
                information and executive judgment, often without being formally designated as decision-support
                systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                In industries such as electrical distribution, leadership decisions rely heavily on accurate
                forecasting, supplier performance data, customer demand trends, and working capital metrics.
                Publications from Supply Chain Brain and the National Association of Electrical Distributors
                consistently emphasize the importance of timely and reliable information in managing supply chain
                volatility. When AI tools summarize or interpret this information, they influence what leaders see
                and prioritize.
            </p>

            <p>
                This trend intersects with Institute of Internal Auditors Standard 2120, which focuses on risk
                identification and assessment, and COSO principles related to the use of relevant and reliable
                information. If AI-generated insights are incomplete, biased, or misunderstood, decision-making
                risk increases even if the underlying data systems remain unchanged.
            </p>

            <p>
                What stands out is that many organizations have not yet established guidance for AI-assisted research
                and analysis. These tools are often treated as productivity aids rather than as components of the
                information flow that shapes executive awareness and risk perception.
            </p>

            <p>
                AI advisory boards can help define acceptable use cases, validation expectations, and disclosure
                requirements. Internal audit teams must also adjust by expanding beyond traditional report reviews
                and developing the capability to assess how AI-generated insights influence risk awareness and
                operational decisions, even when those insights are informally produced.
