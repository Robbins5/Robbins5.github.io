          <p class="exec-subtitle">
            Enterprise transition changes how controls operate, how evidence is produced, and where risk concentrates.
            Standards direction increasingly reinforces risk-based assurance, scalable enablement, and monitoring where feasible.
            The operating model must shift: less default sampling, more population signals, monitoring routines, and reconstructable evidence across systems.

              <p class="thesis-p">
                The audit environment has changed materially. Core systems are being upgraded. Workflow automation is expanding.
                Decisions are increasingly mediated by tools that generate, recommend, route, or prioritize actions. Meanwhile, enterprises scale
                in transaction volume, geographic complexity, speed, and interdependence.
              </p>

              <p class="thesis-p">
                In modern environments, risk frequently concentrates in the seams—between systems, between process owners, and within transitional workarounds
                that persist longer than intended. In these conditions, siloed reviews and periodic sampling produce lagging visibility.

                  When workflows span multiple platforms, “control effectiveness” is no longer a single-system question.

                exception investigation, and control design testing rather than serving as the default method of coverage.

                cannot compete for the same bandwidth. The path is staged: stabilize core processes and access paths first, establish minimum evidence discipline,
                then expand monitoring and cross-system routines where feasibility and value justify the build.
